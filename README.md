# VisionCycle: Auto Labeling Pipeline using NeRF


## Introduction
VisionCycle leverages Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to automate labeling processes for machine learning. It reconstructs a small number of 2D images into 3D using Instant NGP, renders the models from various angles to obtain new views, and automatically creates bounding boxes for YOLO training.

## Pipeline Process
1. **2D to 3D Reconstruction**: Convert 2D photos to 3D models using Instant NGP.
2. **3D to 2D Rendering**: Render 3D models from various angles to produce new 2D images.
3. **Bounding Box Creation**: Auto-generate bounding boxes on the new 2D images.
4. **YOLO Training**: Use the images for machine learning model training.

## Components Description
- **`NeRF.py`**: Executes Instant NGP to transform 2D images into 3D models.
- **`AutoCapture.py`**: Manages the rendering of 3D models into 2D views.
- **`AutoBounding.py`**: Automates bounding box creation in the new 2D images.
